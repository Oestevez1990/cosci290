  This application will run the start and first few features of a text-based
  dating simulation game called Kathy. This game will include the beginning 
  splash screen, the introduction, 
  and serveral alternative scenarios of the brancing paths of the game. 
  
  Note To Professor: My group was originally going to make a Space
  Surival Horror Text-Based Adevnture however we have decided to
  switch it to a dating simulation game.
