Scene1

Greetings brave soul. You are about to undertake the most
difficult quest known to man, "dating". Our story begins with you,
our protagonist, walking to school as any ordinary day. You quickly 
make it to the high school and your first class. As the class starts, the teacher makes an
announcement, a new student will be attending the class. The new student walks in and you
can't believe it, the most beautiful girl you have ever seen. She says "Hello. I'm Kathy"
and so your quest to win Kathy's heart begins

Kathy was asked to take the empty seat next to you. Despite your
paralysis due to her beauty, you've managed to muster up the courage to say
something to her.
